# Hi, I'm VÃ­ctor ðŸ‘‹

I'm a student of programming, currently studying the 3rd semester of Analysis and Systems Development at FATEC Americana.

I love programming, especially JavaScript and its NodeJS, ReactJS & React Native frameworks.

I'm currently an intern at ItaÃº Unibanco, the biggest bank in Brazil, in a team that develops automation and solutions using Python.
